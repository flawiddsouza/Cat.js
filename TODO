- Implement refresh of data-loop on array modifications - push, pop, splice, replaced - plus, perform only the patches instead of refreshing all elements belonging to a data-loop
- refresh data-if on data changes
- Implement data-model, to work like v-model from Vue
- Figure out why
    <input type="text" required data-on-input="addRating = $event.target.value" data-value="addRating">
    attaches the event listener but
    <input type="text" required data-value="addRating" data-on-input="addRating = $event.target.value">
    doesn't. Why does data-on-{event} need to come before data-value? Doesn't make sense. One is not dependent on the other.
- Similar issue:
    <div class="modal-background" data-on-click="console.log($event)" data-if="showComments"></div> works
    but <div data-if="showComments" class="modal-background" data-on-click="console.log($event)"></div> doesn't :/
